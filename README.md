# MeMemo

## A multipurpose notes application

MeMemo is a multipurpose memo and quick note taking application.
It allows users to:

- quickly add memos
- add reminders for certain notes
- set due dates for notes
- auto organize their notes
- write notes in different formats (checklists, bullets)

MeMemo is for the general computer user who wants to quickly note 
down information that isn't complex enough to warrant using a word
processor. The auto-organization tool keeps things organized with
minimal effort. The variety of note templates keeps this application
a one-stop tool for the general user.

I'm interested in this project because an application like this is 
something that I find myself wanting day-to-day. I just use the text
editor on my computer which isn't purpose-built for the things I want
to use it for. Also, learning about how I can get my app to 
automatically organize things can be really cool.
